Deployment book for the Helios service
======================================
Daniel Norberg <dano@spotify.com>

This is the helios deployment book. It is targeted towards Operations and describes how to deploy the helios service.


Overview
--------


Administration
--------------



Projects
--------
Note: Projects are merely advisory.  Applications are deployed with a project.  That
project may exist before initial deploy, but will be created if it doesn't exist already.
If the application is already running, the project name on subsequent deploys must match.
A user deploying an application must be in the project in order to deploy or undeploy it
in that project.  Anyone may add/remove users from projects.  It is intended to prevent
mistakes than real access control.  Creating a project that already exists will merely add
the current user to that project if they are not already a member.

Configuration
-------------

Helios is currently configured through command line parameters. These are controlled through the
helios puppet class.
