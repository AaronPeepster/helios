Building
--------

To build Helios, you'll need the following prerequisites:

- A JDK which supports Java 1.7
- Maven 3

Additionally you need to make sure that maven is configured to talk to our
https://wiki.spotify.net/wiki/Artifactory[Artifactary repository].

Building Helios is then as simple as `mvn package`.
